<body>

  <p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p> 
  
  <p>Here it is, your senior year and the moment has come to start making decisions about which college you will attend. It can be a daunting process filled with uncertainty and nerves, but it&rsquo;s also a very exciting time in your life. This time next year, you&rsquo;ll already be nearing the end of your first college semester! Imagine being settled into your residence hall, making new friends and finding your activity, your club, your people&hellip; the possibilities for your future are endless!</p> 
  
  <p>This week, junior Abby Kyros, a studio art major, wrote a blog post about what it&rsquo;s like <a href="https://blogs.hope.edu/students/admissions/finding-your-thing-at-hope-college?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_nonapp_112918&utm_medium=email">Finding Your &ldquo;Thing&rdquo; at Hope College</a>. Abby&rsquo;s pretty active in campus life. She&rsquo;s involved in YoungLife, Greek Life, the Nykerk Cup Competition, she studies hard and she even works a part-time job on campus. However, as she notes in her post, this didn&rsquo;t happen overnight:</p>
  
  <blockquote>&ldquo;My freshman year I was involved in a handful of other activities like intramural sports, Habitat for Humanity and ski club. Do I play intramural badminton anymore? No, but it was a great experience to explore and I met some great friends! It&rsquo;s important to figure out what fits best for you and your schedule.&rdquo;</blockquote>
