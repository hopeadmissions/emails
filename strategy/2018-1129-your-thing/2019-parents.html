<body>

  <p>Dear ${Contacts.Mothers First Name},</p> 
  
  <p>Here it is, ${Contacts.Preferred First Name}&rsquo;s senior year and the moment has come to start making decisions about which college they will attend. It can be a daunting process filled with uncertainty and nerves, but it&rsquo;s also a very exciting time in their life. This time next year, they will already be nearing the end of their first college semester! Imagine them being settled into their residence hall, making new friends and finding their activity, their club, their people&hellip; the possibilities for the future are endless!</p> 
  
  <p>This week, junior Abby Kyros, an art major, wrote a blog post about what it&rsquo;s like <a href="https://blogs.hope.edu/students/admissions/finding-your-thing-at-hope-college?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_nonapp_parents_112918&utm_medium=email">Finding Your &ldquo;Thing&rdquo; at Hope College</a>. Abby&rsquo;s pretty active in campus life. She&rsquo;s involved in YoungLife, Greek Life, the Nykerk Cup Competition, she studies hard and she even works a part-time job on campus. However, as she notes in her post, this didn&rsquo;t happen overnight:</p>
  
  <blockquote>&ldquo;My freshman year I was involved in a handful of other activities like intramural sports, Habitat for Humanity and ski club. Do I play intramural badminton anymore? No, but it was a great experience to explore and I met some great friends! It&rsquo;s important to figure out what fits best for you and your schedule.&rdquo;</blockquote>
