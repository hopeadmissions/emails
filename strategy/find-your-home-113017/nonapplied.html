<!-- Subject: [Hope College] Find Your Home -->

<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

<p>Here it is, you're 18 years old and the moment has come when you are asked (a lot) to answer one of the most important questions of your young life so far: &quot;Where are you going to college?&quot; It can be daunting question. For me, it created a pit in my stomach. I didn't know how to navigate this new feeling and the endless amounts of college mail my mom would place on my desk didn&rsquo;t help. Maybe you&rsquo;re feeling this way, too. So, the question remains: How do we answer a question that carries more weight than we have ever dealt with before?</p>

<p>To be honest, I actually swung and missed at my first try on this one. I had decided to attend another university for all of the wrong reasons. I choose it because, actually, it was a cop-out. I quickly realized this and forced myself back to square one, but this time I started with the question, &ldquo;where do I feel at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the grace of God, I was led to this small liberal arts college in West Michigan called Hope. It is a place where you walk down the street and are able to say hi to your friends, or complete strangers; a place where coffee and conversations can change your life forever; and, a place that holds you close during dark times and celebrates good times. It's a place that I now call home.</p>

<p>Here I am 3 years later looking back on my experience and what a journey it has been. Life-changing and incredible! So if you are in the place that I was in, unsure of the answer to &ldquo;where will you attend college?&rdquo;, I encourage you to change your perspective. Allow yourself to look at college not as a place you will be leaving your home to go to, but as a place where your next home will be. For me, I found a home in Hope forever.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
