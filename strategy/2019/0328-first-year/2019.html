	<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

  <p><em>Which college classes should I take? How do I register for classes? What will my professors expect of me? Which major will I choose? When will I sign up for housing?</em></p> 
  
  <p>If these questions sound familiar, don&rsquo;t worry! You&rsquo;re not alone. Our campus community is eager to walk alongside all of our first-year students as they transition into college life at Hope starting with <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit/admitted-student-day.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_prosp_susp_032819&utm_medium=email">Admitted Student Day</a> in April.</p>  
  
  <p>Once enrolled, students have the option to participate in a variety <a href="https://blogs.hope.edu/stories-of-hope/interdisciplinary/the-time-in-the-in-between-thriving-in-transition-to-hope/?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_prosp_susp_032819&utm_medium=email">special summer programming and peer-led initiatives</a> to help them prepare for a successful transition to college. Some of these programs include New Student Advising Days, the Summer Bridge Program and <em>First-Year Seminar</em>.</p> 
  
  <blockquote>&ldquo;College is one of those things every incoming freshman has not experienced yet so they don&rsquo;t know what to expect&hellip; A lot of times new students don&rsquo;t know what to ask. With our summer initiatives and other first-year experiences, we want to answer some of their unspoken questions and help to normalize an understanding of expectations.&rdquo;<br>&mdash; Chris Bohle, Associate Director, Student Life</blockquote>
