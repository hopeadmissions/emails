	<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

  <p><em>Which college classes should I take? How do I register for classes? What will my professors expect of me? Which major will I choose? When will I sign up for housing?</em></p> 
  
  <p>If these questions sound familiar, don&rsquo;t worry! You&rsquo;re not alone. Our campus community is eager to walk alongside all of our 800 first-year students as they transition into college life at Hope starting with <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit/admitted-student-day.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_deposits_032819&utm_medium=email">Admitted Student Day</a> in April.</p>
  
  <p>Now that you&rsquo;re enrolled, you&rsquo;ll have options to participate in a variety special summer programming and peer-led initiatives to prepare you for a successful transition to college. Some of these programs include New Student Advising Days, the Summer Bridge Program, FOCUS and <em>First-Year Seminar</em>.</p>
  
  <blockquote>&ldquo;College is one of those things every incoming freshman has not experienced yet so they don&rsquo;t know what to expect&hellip; A lot of times new students don&rsquo;t know what to ask. With our summer initiatives and other first-year experiences, we want to answer some of their unspoken questions and help to normalize an understanding of expectations.&rdquo; &mdash; Chris Bohle, Associate Director, Student Life</blockquote>
  
  <p><a href="https://hope.edu/academics/first-year-experience/index.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_deposits_032819&utm_medium=email">You have so much to look forward to during your first year at Hope</a>: <em>First-Year Seminar</em>, New Student Orientation, Time to Serve, The Pull, Nykerk and more. You will receive your Hope email account soon. Keep checking your Hope email starting in April for some to-do lists, along with important deadlines and instructions for launching your Hope experience. Until then, <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/admitted-students.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_deposits_032819&utm_medium=email">we invite you to look ahead at what&rsquo;s next</a>.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s our privilege to help you make the most of your Hope College experience. We can&rsquo;t wait to get you started!</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  
  <p>Dr. Ryan White<br>
  Associate Dean for Academic Advising and Applied Learning</p>
