<!-- Subject: [Hope College] Ready for ${Contacts.Preferred First Name}’s first year? We are. -->
 
<body>

	<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

  <p><em>Which college classes should I take? How do I register for classes? What will my professors expect of me? Which major will I choose? When will I sign up for housing?</em></p> 
  If these questions sound familiar to ${Contacts.Preferred First Name}, don&rsquo;t worry! {if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Female')]}She&rsquo;s{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Male')]}He&rsquo;s{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Not Specified')]}They&rsquo;re{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == EMPTY)]}They&rsquo;re{/if} not alone. Our campus community is eager to walk alongside all of our 800 first-year students as they transition into college life at Hope starting with <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit/admitted-student-day.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_admits_parents_032819&utm_medium=email">Admitted Student Day</a> in April.</p>
  
  <p>Once enrolled, students have the option to participate in a variety special summer programming and peer-led initiatives to help them prepare for a successful transition to college. Some of these programs include New Student Advising Days, the Summer Bridge Program and <em>First-Year Seminar</em>.</p>
  
  <blockquote>&ldquo;College is one of those things every incoming freshman has not experienced yet so they don&rsquo;t know what to expect&hellip; A lot of times new students don&rsquo;t know what to ask. With our summer initiatives and other first-year experiences, we want to answer some of their unspoken questions and help to normalize an understanding of expectations.&rdquo;<br>&mdash; Chris Bohle, Associate Director, Student Life</blockquote>
  
  <p>There&rsquo;s so much for ${Contacts.Preferred First Name} to look forward to at Hope next fall: <em>First-Year Seminar</em>, New Student Orientation, Time to Serve, The Pull, Nykerk and more. Shortly after we receive {if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Female')]}her{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Male')]}his{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Not Specified')]}their{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == EMPTY)]}their{/if} deposit, we&rsquo;ll send a new Hope email account. Encourage ${Contacts.Preferred First Name} to check it out as it contains some to-do lists, along with important deadlines and instructions for launching their Hope experience. Until then, <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/admitted-students.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_admits_parents_032819&utm_medium=email">we invite you to look ahead at what&rsquo;s next</a>.</p>
