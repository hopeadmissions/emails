  <p>As graduation for our seniors draws near, we asked our Student Congress President Jason Gomery &lsquo;19, a Florida native, to reflect on his college-search experience and what drew him all the way to Hope. We think you&rsquo;ll be interested in hearing what he had to say&hellip;</p>
  
  <em><p>Just a few years ago, I was in your shoes &mdash; making a decision about where to go to college. Today I&rsquo;m preparing to graduate from Hope in May with a degree in business.</p> 
  
  <p>To be honest, I never pictured myself at Hope College. I lived my entire life in Florida and always planned to attend a large public university in my home state. At the recommendation of a friend, I visited Hope during my senior year of high school. From the moment I stepped foot on campus, I knew something was different about this place.</p> 
  
  <p>After returning from my visit, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about Hope but I told myself, &ldquo;I should probably stick close to home.&rdquo; Still, as May 1 approached, Hope was my top choice. My family encouraged me to give Hope a shot, and I made my deposit! I was excited but still nervous. I had so many questions. You might have the same questions too, so please allow me to offer some insights.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Will I make friends?</strong> With so many student groups and activities, it was easy to immerse myself in campus life. I was &ldquo;on the rope&rdquo; for <a href="https://hope.edu/offices/student-life/pull/?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_admits_042519&utm_medium=email">The Pull</a> and became a member of <a href="https://hope.edu/offices/student-life/student-congress/?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_admits_042519&utm_medium=email">Student Congress</a>, which led me to meet some of my best friends.</p> 
  
  <p><strong>Where will I spend my breaks?</strong> Being more than a 1,000 miles away from home, I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get home for shorter fall and winter breaks. No worries. Before the second week of school was over, I had already received many invitations from new friends to join them for fall break. It still amazes me how welcoming the Hope community is!</p>
  
  <p><strong>Could I make it through Michigan winters?</strong> Ah, the million dollar question! My roommate, who was from Michigan, gave me great advice about a good winter coat and boots. (Here&rsquo;s the secret: If you wear the right clothes, the cold and snow are not a problem!) Plus, this Floridian has discovered the beauty of all the seasons. Fall color, winter snow and spring blossoms &mdash; they are all beautiful in their own way!</p>
  
  <p><strong>Will Hope prepare me for success after graduation?</strong> Yes! I took a business marketing class my junior year that allowed me to gain real-world experience with a real-world client, Steelcase, a global furniture manufacturer. At the end of the semester, Steelcase offered me a summer internship in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Best of all, I&rsquo;m excited to start my career pursuing my passions after graduation next month.</p>
  
  <p>I hope my story helps you. As you can see, I think Hope is a special place, and I believe you&rsquo;ll feel that same way about it, too. <a href="https://hope.edu/deposit?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_admits_042519&utm_medium=email">Submit ${Contacts.Preferred First Name}&rsquo;s enrollment deposit today.</a></p></em>
