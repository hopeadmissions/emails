  <p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

  <p>Last week was a BIG week at Hope. On Thursday, our entire campus community raised over $250,000 on Day of Giving. On Friday, we hosted one of the nation's largest collections of student-faculty work during the Celebration of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity. And on Saturday, we welcomed 400+ students to begin their life in orange and blue at Admitted Student Day.</p>

  <p>Today, ${Contacts.Preferred First Name} is deciding if {if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Female')]}she sees herself{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Male')]}he sees himself{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Not Specified')]}they seem themself{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == EMPTY)]}they seem themself{/if} here at Hope College. Watch this video and then hit &ldquo;reply&rdquo; to let me know what you&rsquo;re thinking:</p>
