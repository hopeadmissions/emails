  <p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

  <p>Last week was a BIG week at Hope. On Thursday, our entire campus community raised over $250,000 on Day of Giving. On Friday, we hosted one of the nation's largest collections of student-faculty work during the Celebration of Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity. And on Saturday, we welcomed 400+ students to begin their life in orange and blue at Admitted Student Day.</p>

  <p>Today, you&rsquo;re deciding if you see yourself at Hope College. Watch this video and then <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/staff.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2019_admits_041819&utm_medium=email">reach out to your rep</a> to let them know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
