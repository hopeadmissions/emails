  <p>${Contacts.Mothers First Name},</p>

  <p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Bill Vanderbilt, Vice President for Admissions here at Hope College. As ${Contacts.Preferred First Name} wraps up {if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Female')]}her{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Male')]}his{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Not Specified')]}their{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == EMPTY)]}their{/if} junior year I&rsquo;m guessing the college search is getting real, and we&rsquo;re here to help along the way.</p>

  <p>I know that choosing a college is a big decision, so I&rsquo;d like to offer you a little advice! Like any big project, you and ${Contacts.Preferred First Name} have to take this one in a bunch of little steps. Let&rsquo;s start with this summer&hellip;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Your mission for May, June, and July: help ${Contacts.Preferred First Name} identify the colleges &amp; universities to which {if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Female')]}she{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Male')]}he{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == 'Not Specified')]}they{/if}{if [(%{Contacts.Gender} == EMPTY)]}they{/if} might apply this fall.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make plans to visit the colleges on ${Contacts.Preferred First Name}&rsquo;s list. And don&rsquo;t just drive through campuses (although that&rsquo;s better than nothing) &mdash; actually schedule an official campus visit with all of the schools that interest you.</p>
  
  <p>We&rsquo;ve got ten current Hope students in our office who are making Holland their home for the summer so that they can welcome you to our community and show you around. <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit/summer-visits.html?utm_source=radius&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2020_all_051619">Schedule your summer visit to Hope College today.</a></p>
  
  <p>See you soon,</p>
  
  <p>Bill Vanderbilt<br>
  Vice President for Admissions</p>
