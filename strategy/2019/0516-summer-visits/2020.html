  <p>Hello! As you wrap up your junior year I&rsquo;m guessing your college search is getting real, and I&rsquo;m here to help along the way.</p>
  
  <p>I know that choosing your college is a big decision, so I&rsquo;d like to offer you a little advice! Like any big project, take this one in a bunch of little steps. Let&rsquo;s start with this summer&hellip;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Your mission for May, June, and July: identify the colleges &amp; universities to which you might apply this fall.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make plans to visit the colleges on your list. And don&rsquo;t just drive through campuses (although that&rsquo;s better than nothing) &mdash; actually schedule an official campus visit with all of the schools that interest you.</p>
  
  <p>We&rsquo;ve got ten current Hope students in our office who are making Holland their home for the summer so that they can welcome you to our community and show you around. <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit/summer-visits.html?utm_source=radius&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2020_all_051619">Schedule your summer visit to Hope College today.</a></p>
  
  <p>See you soon,</p>
  
  <p>Bill Vanderbilt<br>
  Vice President for Admissions</p>
