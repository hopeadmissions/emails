	<title>My Best Decision - Seniors (Admits; In-State) -Â 20180426</title>

<!-- Subject: [Hope College] This was my best decision. -->
 
<body>

	<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>
	
	<p>Just a few years ago, I was in your shoes &mdash; making a decision about where to go to college.</p>
	
	<p>To be honest, I never pictured myself at Hope College. I lived my entire life in Florida and always planned to attend a large public university in my home state. At the recommendation of a friend, I visited Hope during my senior year of high school. From the moment I stepped foot on campus, I knew something was different about this place.</p> 
	
	<p>After returning from my visit, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about Hope but I told myself, &ldquo;I should probably stay in Florida.&rdquo; Still, as May 1 approached, Hope was my top choice. My family encouraged me to give Hope a shot, and I made my deposit! I was excited but still nervous. I had so many questions. You might have the same questions too, so please allow me to offer some insights on why I chose your state over Florida.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Will I make friends?</strong> With so many student groups and activities, it was easy to immerse myself in campus life. I was &ldquo;on the rope&rdquo; for <a href="https://hope.edu/offices/student-life/pull?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=admits_instate_2018_0426&utm_medium=email">The Pull</a> and became a member of <a href="https://hope.edu/offices/student-life/student-congress?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=admits_instate_2018_0426&utm_medium=email">Student Congress</a>, which led me to meet some of my best friends.</p> 
	
	<p><strong>Where will I spend my breaks and weekends?</strong> From the time I moved in, my weekends were full with so many fun activities on campus. And long before fall break, I had already received many invitations from new friends to join them. It still amazes me how welcoming the Hope community is!</p>
	
	<p><strong>What about Michigan winters?</strong> Well, you know the answer to that! My roommate who was from Michigan like you, gave me great advice about a good winter coat and boots. (And I learned the secret: If you wear the right clothes, the cold and snow are not a problem!) Plus, this Floridian has discovered the beauty of all the seasons. Fall color, winter snow and spring blossoms &mdash; they are all beautiful in their own way!</p>
	
	<p><strong>Will Hope prepare me for success after graduation?</strong> Yes! Last fall, I took a business marketing class which allowed me to gain real-world experience working with a real-world client, Steelcase, a global furniture manufacturer. At the end of the semester, Steelcase reached out and offered me a summer internship, which starts this May in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
	
	<p>I hope this helps you. As you can see, I think Hope is a special place, and I believe you&rsquo;ll feel that same way about it, too. <a href="https://hope.edu/deposit?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=admits_instate_2018_0426&utm_medium=email">Submit your deposit today.</a></p>
	
	<p>Sincerely,<br>
