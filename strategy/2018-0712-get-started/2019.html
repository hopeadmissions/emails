	<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

	<p>Did you know you can start your <a href="https://apply.commonapp.org/Login?ma=390&tref=email_071218">Common Application</a> today and submit beginning Aug. 1? The Common Application is open now through July 26 so you can begin working on an application to Hope College that is anything but common.</p> 
	
	<p>A few things you can do now to beat the fall rush: Start your essay, tell us about you, your family, your accomplishments, and of course, your academic career.</p>
