<!-- Subject: [Hope College] Start the Common App now, submit Aug. 1 -->
 
<body> 
	
	<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>

	<p>Did you know your student can start their <a href="https://apply.commonapp.org/Login?ma=390&tref=email_071218">Common Application</a> today and submit it beginning Aug. 1? The Common Application is open now through July 26 so they can begin working on an application to Hope College that is anything but common.</p> 
	
	<p>A few things your student can do now to beat the fall rush: Start their essay, tell us about themself, their family, their accomplishments, and of course, their academic career.</p> 
	
	<p>Be aware, though, the Common Application will be unavailable July 27&ndash;31 for the fall rollout. It will reopen on August 1 for them to submit their application, and our Admissions team is ready to help them with this process. Here are a few resources we think your student may find helpful:</p>
