	<p>You might be curious to know 94% of the Hope College Class of 2017 was employed or in graduate programs within six months of graduation, and that 94% of the Class of 2017 who applied to graduate school were accepted to their first or second choice.</p>
	
	<p>Hope College grads achieve success &mdash; in their workplaces and communities, in every U.S. state and in over 80 countries. Powered by a Hope education, they distinguish themselves by living lives of leadership and service.</p>
	
	<p>Wherever life as a Hope student takes you, our alumni network is standing ready to support <em>your</em> accomplishments here.</p>
	
	<p>The first step toward a lifetime of success starts with a campus visit. <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit?utm_source=radius&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=prizm_0318">Schedule yours today!</a></p>
