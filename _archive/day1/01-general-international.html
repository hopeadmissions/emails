          <h2 style="font-family:georgia; font-weight:bold; color:#4D4F53;">We are excited to invite you to apply for research experiences in science and engineering that begin your very first semester at Hope. This means you can be doing real hands-on research from day one!</h2>

          <p>${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>
          
          <p>Are you interested in learning more about phages (viruses that infect bacteria)? Or would you like to tackle an engineering challenge with a customer from our local community? If so, check out our <a href="https://www.hope.edu/day1/phage-discovery">Day1: Phage Discovery</a> and <a href="https://www.hope.edu/day1/edge">Day 1: EDGE</a> programs today.  These are first semester courses that can provide a great stepping stone to other valuable research experiences. Unique programs like these are part of the reason our graduates are regularly admitted to the top graduate programs in the United States.</p>

          <p>We hope you'll apply for one of these Day1 research communities. Our <a href="https://www.hope.edu/day1">website</a> has additional information and the link to the short application that is due by Monday, March 16, 2015. Please note that <a href="https://www.hope.edu/day1/phage-discovery">Day 1: Phage Discovery</a> and <a href="https://www.hope.edu/day1/edge">Day1: EDGE</a> are the Day1 programs available to international students because they will not conflict with International Student Orientation.</p>
          
          <p>We can't wait to see the difference you will make as a Hope College student.</p>
          
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
