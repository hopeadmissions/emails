          <h2 style="font-family:georgia; font-weight:bold; color:#4D4F53;">You are invited to start your career at Hope College with real hands-on research from day one. We are excited to offer you, as a first-year student, a variety of interesting research experiences in math, science and engineering.</h2>

          <p>${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>
          
          <p>There are five (5) great Day1 programs: Phage Discovery, EDGE, Michigan Rocks, Watershed, and Great Lakes. Where will your research journey take you? Learn more about phages (viruses that infect bacteria) or threatened native species in our sand dunes. Travel to northern Michigan to study ancient volcanoes, inland seas, and fossils. Tackle an engineering challenge with a customer from our local community. Or investigate the human impact on our local rivers and lakes!</p>

          <p>We hope you'll join us for one of these Day1 research programs. Check out our <a href="https://hope.edu/day1">website</a> for more information and <a href="https://hope.hobsonsradius.com/ssc/aform/N67f4md70B0R0x67028673.ssc">complete the very short application</a> by Monday, March 16, 2015.</p>
          
          <p>We can't wait to see the difference you will make as a Hope College student.</p>
          
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
