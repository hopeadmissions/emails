                      A unique research opportunity in mathematics.

                    	<strong>${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>Do you like to learn by doing, not just by sitting in a classroom? Are you interested in doing field research on the beaches of Lake Michigan a few days before classes start? Are you interested in how coastal communities interact with the Great Lakes? Do you want to develop close connections with other students and be an integral part of an active research community? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then we would like you to consider joining us for a unique and distinctive course at Hope College during the fall 2014 semester.</p>

                    <p>We have selected you as a potential candidate to enroll in a special research-based Statistics/First Year Seminar (FYS) course at Hope. Your outstanding academic record indicates that you are qualified for this course, and our experience shows that you would thrive as part of a team of young researchers.  This course is only available for a select group of 20 incoming first-year students. <i>This email is your invitation to apply.</i></p>

                    <p>The Statistics/FYS course integrates three related components. If you are accepted into the course, you will get actual, hands-on experience working on a <b>scientific research</b> problem related to the Great Lakes. This will include statistical analysis of data that you will collect. You will also be part of a first year seminar class, in which you will <b>explore the relationship between communities and the Great Lakes</b>. This includes the history of these interactions, the economic ties between coastal communities and the Lakes, and the resultant impacts on the ecosystems of the Great Lakes. We will also discuss how communities are trying to balance the use and preservation of the Lakes. The third component of the course is an introductory statistics course in which you will <b>develop an understanding of how statistics works to inform scientific research</b>. As part of the statistics course we will analyze data from studies related to the Great Lakes, including the data that you collected.</p>
                    
                    <p class="subhead">Course Details</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                    	<li>The course will begin with an intensive three-day research experience (August 19-21). You will arrive on campus on August 18, a few days before the rest of the freshman class.</li>
											<li>The three-day research experience will include field work during the day at local beaches on Lake Michigan.</li>
											<li>You will learn modern statistical approaches to data analysis (randomization methods).</li>
											<li>This course is a unique and valuable experience whether you are interested in the social sciences, natural sciences, health professions, mathematics/statistics, engineering, or any other field that involves data collection and analysis.</li>
											<li>The course will be conducted by two PhD faculty members whose research is closely related to the research that you will be doing.</li>
                    </ul>
