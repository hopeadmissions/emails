  <p align="left"><strong>Greetings from the Offices of Parent Relations and Admissions!</strong></p>
  <p align="left">As the Director of Alumni and Parent Relations, I have the pleasure of working with Hope parents who have an interest in serving the college in a volunteer capacity. One of the volunteer opportunities available for parents is the Parent Contact Program. As a Hope parent, your perspective of the Hope experience is unique and can be of significant value to the parents and families of prospective students who are considering attending Hope College. We invite you to participate in this special initiative!</p>
  <p align="left">Volunteers for the Parent Contact Program agree to call a select number of parents and families of admitted students to offer their perspective on the Hope experience.  There&rsquo;s no need to brush up on your Hope College statistics! The focus of the call is on your impression of the academic program, Christian character, social environment, and overall spirit of the Hope community. A representative from the Admissions office will follow up with any specific questions that may arise.</p>
  <p align="left">The Parent Contact Program has proven to be very effective, helpful, and appreciated by families whose students are considering Hope.  Volunteer callers have found the experience to be enjoyable and rewarding as well.  I hope you will join us in sharing the Hope College experience with these families who are just learning about everything Hope has to offer.  If you are interested in volunteering your time, please fill out our registration form:</p>
