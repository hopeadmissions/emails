        </p>
      <p align="left">I have enjoyed participating in the <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/acp/">Alumni Calling Program</a> the past few years because it gives me a chance to give back to Hope in a way that doesn&rsquo;t require a financial donation, requires only a little bit of my time and is meaningful to prospective students. &nbsp;I enjoy hearing about the students' study plans, their campus visit and how they learned about Hope. &nbsp;They appreciate hearing about my time at Hope and why I chose Hope. Sometimes I get questions I can&rsquo;t answer, but I just refer them to their admissions rep and mention the questions in the Admissions feedback form.&nbsp; The personal touch seems to make the students feel special and that someone cares about them and their college decision! <br>

          <br>
          Learning about a Hope alum&nbsp;from my area of Texas was really encouraging and made my decision easier. <br>
          &mdash;<strong>Kelly Pearce, TX</strong></p>
      <p align="left">I really wanted to find the right college.&nbsp; It was very helpful to hear from someone who had already been through the process at Hope College.&nbsp;<br>
        &mdash;<strong>Anna Robison, IA</strong><br>
        </p>
      <p align="left">She gave me insight into what her Hope experience was really like and told me things not in a&nbsp;catalog&nbsp;or campus tour. It was much more personal.&nbsp;<br>
        &mdash;<strong>Elizabeth Hidlebaugh, FL</strong><br>
        </p>
      <p align="left">The call affirmed my belief that at Hope I would matter as an individual and was wanted.  It was one of the final factors in choosing Hope. <br>
        &mdash;<strong>Daniel Owens, OH</strong></p>
