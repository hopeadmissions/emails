								<p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>
								
								<p>If I had to do to college over, I would choose Hope College every. single. time.  My journey through Hope was a fairly normal one, by Hope&rsquo;s standard... that is, until my senior year. I studied biology, took part in research and multiple student clubs and was a member of the track team all four years.</p>
								
								<p>Then a surprise: Three months before graduation, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. Cancer. My senior year drastically changed. Over the course of two months, I had two surgeries, a bone marrow biopsy, pulmonary function tests, and two different heart tests.  I refused to give up track, though. I got to compete in two track meets on spring break.</p>
								
								<p>Still, I knew I needed to finish my Hope experience strong. When I told my coaches I had one last athletic goal &mdash; to compete in the conference championship in May &mdash; they were behind me the entire time with care and concern. My throws coach &mdash; I throw discus, shot put and javelin &mdash; would send me weekly texts to check in. My teammates were truly incredible, too. They sent flowers, wrote me notes individually and made a huge &ldquo;Team Haley&rdquo; poster. The love that was nurtured and grown over my four years on the track team has been one of the greatest influences in my life, and not just during my cancer diagnosis.</p>
								
								<p>The bottom line is this: I would not have been able to continue competing and getting my education without the support from the entire Hope family. I have been so blessed by so many different people here. Hope has done so much for me, even before cancer came into my life. This is simply a special place with special people.</p>
								
								<p>If you have any questions for me or about my story, please let me know. Or, go to <a href="www.tryingtoservetheworld.wordpress.com"> my blog</a> to learn more. I&rsquo;m glad to help with any questions you have about Hope or my story.</p>
								
								<p> Be Strong. Be True <p>
									<p>Go (to) Hope! <p>	
								
								<p>Sincerely,<br>
									Haley Fischman<br>
									Track and Field Student-Athlete
									Hope College Class of 2018</p>
