  <p>Dear ${Contacts.Preferred First Name},</p>
  
  <p>There&rsquo;s no substitute for seeing a college campus in person, and we invite you to do just that here at Hope sometime this summer.</p>
  
  <p>(Not too familiar with Hope College? <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/landing/summer-search.html?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2020_search_052819&utm_medium=email">We&rsquo;ve got you covered.</a>)</p>
  
  <p>In the meantime, let me introduce you to a couple of students &mdash; Tucker &rsquo;19 and Grace &rsquo;22. Recently they took our Instagram followers on a live tour of Hope&rsquo;s campus (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18068736109031654/">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoSw4rKBayQ">YouTube</a>) and we saved it in our highlights so you could take a look. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18068736109031654/">Check it out on Instagram.</a></p>
  
  <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve gotten a taste of the Hope experience, come see this place for yourself! You can <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit/summer-visits.html#individual?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2020_search_052819&utm_medium=email">schedule an individual visit</a> on most weekdays, or <a href="https://hope.edu/admissions/visit/summer-visits.html#anchor-days?utm_source=radius&utm_campaign=2020_search_052819&utm_medium=email">come for one of our special Anchor Days</a> on July 19 and August 2.
